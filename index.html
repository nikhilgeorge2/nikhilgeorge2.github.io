               <p>
                I study how technology reshapes work and careers, combining novel data science approaches with large-scale data from job postings, resumes, and HR systems to generate insights for both labor markets and organizations.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am a PhD Candidate in Information Systems at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. My dissertation research comprises two projects examining technological change and workforce dynamics. The first develops an innovative empirical framework to distinguish how different types of technological change affect worker mobility - whether technology requires new skill acquisition or eliminates tasks entirely. Using skill similarity measures derived from job postings and extensive resume data, I show how these distinct technological impacts lead to systematically different patterns in worker transitions and wage outcomes. The second project demonstrates how firms can leverage their internal HR data to develop evidence-based talent management approaches, revealing how skill distances between positions predict mobility patterns and inform both job matching and skill development programs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Beyond my dissertation, I study AI and analytics adoption across firms and its relationship with human capital, as well as how remote work affects specialized talent engagement and career trajectories. My other research interests include technology disruption in entertainment media and behavioral data science.
               </p>

                I am on the Job Market (2024-25).

                    Originally from Kerala, India, I currently reside in Pittsburgh with my wife, Sweety Sidhu. In my free time, I appreciate good food, enjoy watching TV series, and find the fall colors particularly pleasant.
