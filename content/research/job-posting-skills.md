description: "This paper develops a methodology using internal job postings and large language models to measure and validate employee skill fit, demonstrating its predictive power in hiring decisions."
summary: "We develop a methodology using internal job postings and large language models to measure employee skill fit. Critically, validating the skill-fit against 1,034 internal selection decisions, we find it robustly predicts hiring: applicants with higher skill fit are over twice as likely to be selected for the same role."

**##### Abstract**
Despite widespread adoption of Human Capital Management (HCM) systems, organizations struggle to extract systematic workforce intelligence from their accumulated HR data. Using rich contextual information derived from four years of HCM data from a leading financial services firm and textual data in job postings, we systematically measure how well employees' current skills match the requirements of new job openings. These skill-fit scores are validated using actual hiring decisions from 1,034 internal applications. The measure robustly predicts hiring success: applicants with one standard deviation higher skill fit are 2.25 times more likely to be selected when competing for identical positions. This demonstrates that job postings and HCM data contain rich, decision-relevant skill signals previously untapped by organizations. These validated skill-fit measures also reveal important workforce patterns â€“ a) 14.8% of employees face limited skill-aligned opportunities, and b) 54.9% of unsuccessful job applicants are overlooking suitable alternatives. Our empirical approach provides a replicable framework for developing validated skill-fit measures from readily available HCM data without additional data collection or validation effort, creating a foundation for deeper workforce analytics.
