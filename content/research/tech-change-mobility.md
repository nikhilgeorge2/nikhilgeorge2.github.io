##### Abstract
The interplay of skills, technological change, and worker mobility is central to understanding evolving labor markets. This paper enhances our understanding of worker mobility by introducing a novel, data-driven approach to mapping occupational skills, constructing occupation-specific skill embeddings from job posting-derived prompts. This improved ability to account for worker mobility, compared to traditional measures, allows us to analyze the distinct impacts of technological change: both technology enhancing tasks by requiring new skills, and technology eliminating tasks. Combining this enhanced skill measure with technology exposure metrics and worker transition histories (2002-2018), our analysis reveals contrasting mobility patterns. Specifically, when technology enhances tasks but requires new, difficult-to-acquire skills within their initial occupations, moves to skill-distant occupations involve transitioning to lower-paying occupations, suggesting involuntary mobility and skill redundancy due to the difficulty in acquiring these new skills. Conversely, when technology eliminates tasks, skill-distant moves are associated with transitioning to relatively higher-paying occupations, indicating a strategic reorientation away from declining skill clusters towards opportunities where their existing skills remain valued. These findings highlight the relevance of understanding the skills landscape for effective workforce development policies aimed at smoothing worker transitions in the face of technological change.
