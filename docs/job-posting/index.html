<h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>
<p>Despite significant investments in HRIS systems, evidence of firms building validated analytics from this data remains scant. We develop a methodology using internal job postings to measure employee skill fit. Analyzing four years of data from a major financial services firm, we leverage large language models to evaluate 7,500 job pairs, supervising the learning of custom skill-fit measures from job posting text. Critically, validating the skill-fit against 1,034 internal selection decisions, we find it robustly predicts hiring: applicants with higher skill fit are over twice as likely to be selected for the same role, with predictive strength greater for less technical positions. This establishes job postings as a rich source for firm-specific skill intelligence. Building on these validated measures, we quantify each applicant’s internal &ldquo;opportunity landscape&rdquo;. Our analysis shows that while applicants from across the opportunity spectrum apply to roles with low job-to-job skill alignment, those with severely limited access to well-aligned roles are more than twice as likely to do so. This pattern suggests such misaligned applications reflect both underlying skill gaps and broader frictions in the internal job market. Our work offers a replicable, LLM-enhanced methodology for firms to transform existing HR data into validated skill intelligence, enabling a data-driven foundation for strategic workforce development.</p>
